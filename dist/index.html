                                This book was great. I loved the adventure theme and the fact that it felt like I was playing alongside the kids. I liked that way I would keep on guessing what was going ot happen next, and even though I had loads of ideas, none of them would ever be right!.</p>

                                <p class="subheading">5 Feet Apart, by Mikki Daughtry, Rachael Lippincott, and Tobias Iaconis</p>
                                <p>This book is love story about two people who can't go within 6 feet of each other, let alone touch, because they both have an illness calld Cystic fibrosis.<br>
                                I'm not usually a fan of books that are romantic, but with this one, I couldn't stop reading. It often had me up super late at night trying to read on further!</p>
